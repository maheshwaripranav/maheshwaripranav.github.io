    In short, I tell you what Weinberg plead<br>
    To the young scientists like you and me!<br>
</p>

<p>
    Of all the vastness of knowledge sea,<br>
    Believe me, not all literature is useful to thee<br>
    Start your research right now young scientist<br>
    Learn what you need along the alley.<br>
</p>

<p>
    Don’t run your hands over easy entities,
    Mastering the well known isn’t researcher’s glory
    Push your limits to the unsolvable mess
    Aim for hard waters, ‘n’ dive deep in the sea.
</p>

<p>
    The next lesson’s truth is hardest to believe
    You’ll try wrong problems ‘n’ time will flee.
    It’s hard to find the right thought at right time, but remember,
    Nobel moment arrives after efforts of eternity
</p>

<p>
    The next advice is to read science’ history,
    It’s true; science won’t give you a huge money tree.
    A researcher’s pride always lies in the fact,
    Next-gen will read How he solved the mystery.
